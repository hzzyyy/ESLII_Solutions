    "The objective function $\\frac12\\left(\\mathbf{y}-\\mathbf{X\\beta}\\right)^{T}\\left(\\mathbf{y}-\\mathbf{X\\beta}\\right)$, is a quadratic form and has the constant Hessian matrix $\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X}$. We know that this matrix is positive semidefinite, and thus the objective function is convex. We have only one inequity constraint, and the function is $L_1$ norm of $\\mathbf{\\beta}$ minus a constant. By triangle inequitlity and absolute scalability of a norm function, we know that any norm function is a convex function. A convex function minus a constant is still a convex function, so we conclude that the function in the inequality constraint is also convex. In addition, the domain for both the objective funciton and constraint function is $\\mathbb{R}^p$ and thus convex. We conclue that the primal problem is convex. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can easily verify that the point $\\mathbf{\\beta}=\\mathbf{0}$ is an interior point of the primal domain $\\mathbb{R}^p$, and that it is strictly primal feasible: $\\left\\Vert \\mathbf{0}\\right\\Vert _{1}-t = -t < 0$. The Slater condition is satisfied for the primal problem, together with the fact that it is convex, we can conclude that strong duality holds for this problem.

    "The last three conditions are a direct result of $\\beta^+$ and $\\beta^-$ being the postive and negative part of $\\beta$. The last condition is not convex, complicating this problem. Let's see what happens if we drop the last condition. \n",
    "\n",
    "Without the last condition, we get a convex primal problem. In addition, all the constraint functions are affine, so the strong duality holds. If there exits a solution satifying all the KKT conditions, then it must be optimal. Let's first assume that such a solution does exit and we obtain the minimum value of objective function without the last constraint, namely $\\hat{p}^\\star$. Let's denote the optimal of the problem with the last constraint as $p^\\star$, then we must have $\\hat{p}^\\star \\le p^\\star$ because the former is the minimum on a larger feasible set. By larger, we mean one set contrains the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the solution producing $\\hat{p}^\\star$ satisfies the last condition then we have $\\hat{p}^\\star = p^\\star$. If it doesn't satisfy the last condition, then in this solution, there is at least one pair of positive $\\beta_j^+$ and $\\beta_j^-$. Without loss of generality, let's assume  $\\beta_j^+ =a > \\beta_j^-=b>0$. The exciting fact is that if we update this pair with new values: $\\beta_j^+ = a - b$ and $\\beta_j^-=0$, the value of the objective function doesn't change, and all the previously satisfied constraints are still satisfied. For the last constraint, we have one less pair of $\\beta_j^+$ and $\\beta_j^-$ violating it. By repeating such process for all the pairs violating the last constaint, we can modify the solution producing $\\hat{p}^\\star$ to become a feasible solution for the problem with the last constraint. Since this modifying process doesn't change the objective function value, we proved that there is a feasible solution in the problem with the last constraint producing an objective of $\\hat{p}^\\star$. $p^\\star$ must be less or equal to the value produced by any of its feasible solution, so $p^\\star \\le \\hat{p}^\\star$. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the arguements in the above two paragraphs combined, we proved that $p^\\star = \\hat{p}^\\star$. This is good news, becaue the problem can be solved in this way: find the solution of the problem without last constraint by KKT conditions. If this solution happens to satisfies the last constraint as well, we are done. If it doesn't, modify it by the process mentioned above to make it satisfy the last constraint and the solution is obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we happily ignore the last constaint? Yes and no. It can be ignored in the sense that the solution obtained by KKT conditions will always satisfy the last constraint, as we are going to prove very soon. It cannot be ignored because the optimal solution without the last constraint is not always unique, and in that case, the solution produced by KKT is one of them, or the 'best' of them. Let's consider the case when $t$ is sufficiently large, and in this case, the constaint on the norm of the parameters doesn't kick in, so all parameters are active. In this case the solution is just the full least square solution. If we pick any of the pair $\\beta_j^+$ and $\\beta_j^-$ and add the same positive constant to them, the problem is still optimal with all the constraints satisfied. \n",
    "\n",
    "We notice that the value of $\\beta$ doesn't change at all during such kind of shift of $\\beta_j^+$ and $\\beta_j^-$, but the solution is getting closer to the boundary where the first constraint is violated. So if we define the set of $\\beta_j^+$ and $\\beta_j^-$ producing the same $\\beta$ as being equivalent, then the solution of the problem without the last constraint defines an equivalent class, and we can choose the pair of $\\beta_j^+$ and $\\beta_j^-$ such that one of them is $0$ to represent this equivalent class. This representitive is, not suprisingly, the optimal solution of the problem with the last constraint, and it is the 'best' in the sense that it is most distant from the boundary of the first constraint (the norm constraint).\n",
