# ESLII_Solutions

This is a selective solution manual I've been writing during my self study of the classic text book "The Elements of Statistical Learning". The authors Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman did such a great job that makes it possible to study this book all by myself. During my study, I found the carefully chose problem set extremely valuable and would like to share my solution with the all the people who are enthusiastic in statistical learning. Please, if you find any flaw in my solution, raise an issue, and I will be glad to discuss with you.
